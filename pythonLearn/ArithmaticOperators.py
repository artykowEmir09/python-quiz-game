# Arithmetic & Math
# Exercise 1 — Movie Tickets 🟢
# Ask the user for:
# ticket price
# number of tickets
# Calculate the total cost.
# Example:
# Ticket price: 12.50
# Number of tickets: 3
# Total: 37.5
"""
ticket_price = float(input("Enter ticket prices: "))
quantity = int(input("How many tickets do you want: "))
total = ticket_price * quantity
print(f"Ticket price: {ticket_price}")
print(f"Quantity: {quantity}")
print(f"Total: {total}")
"""
# Exercise 2 — Trip Distance 🟢
# Ask for:
# distance traveled in km
# fuel used in liters
# Calculate:
# km per liter = distance / fuel
# Example:
# Distance: 450
# Fuel: 30
# Fuel efficiency: 15.0 km/L

distance = float(input("Distance Traveled: (km)"))
fuel = float (input("How many liter did it take? (l)"))
km_per_liter = distance / fuel
print (f"Fuel efficeincy: {km_per_liter} km/L")





# Exercise 3 — Salary Calculator 🟡
# Ask for:
# monthly salary
# monthly bonus
# Calculate:
# yearly salary without bonus
# yearly bonus
# total yearly income
# Example:

# Monthly salary: 3000
# Monthly bonus: 500

# Yearly salary: 36000
# Yearly bonus: 6000
# Total yearly income: 42000
# Exercise 4 — Temperature Conversion 🟡

# Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius.

# Convert it to Fahrenheit using:

# F = (C × 9/5) + 32

# Example:

# Celsius: 25

# Fahrenheit: 77.0
# Exercise 5 — Shopping Discount 🟡

# Ask for:

# product price
# quantity
# discount percentage

# Calculate:

# subtotal
# discount amount
# final price

# Twist: The user enters the discount as a normal percentage.

# Example:

# Price: 80
# Quantity: 3
# Discount: 15

# Subtotal: 240
# Discount amount: 36
# Final price: 204

# Think carefully about converting 15 into 0.15.

# Exercise 6 — BMI Calculator 🟠

# Ask the user for:

# weight in kg
# height in meters

# Calculate:

# BMI = weight / (height × height)

# Example:

# Weight: 70
# Height: 1.75

# BMI: 22.857...

# You don't need to round it yet.

# Exercise 7 — Restaurant Bill 🟠

# A restaurant customer enters:

# food cost
# number of people
# tax percentage
# tip percentage

# Calculate:

# Tax amount
# Tip amount
# Final bill
# Amount each person pays

# Example:

# Food cost: 100
# People: 4
# Tax: 6
# Tip: 10

# Your program should calculate everything.

# Exercise 8 — Currency Breakdown 🔴

# Ask the user for an amount of money.

# For example:

# Amount: 187

# Calculate how many:

# 100 bills
# 50 bills
# 20 bills
# 10 bills
# 5 bills
# 1 bills

# are needed.

# For 187, the result should be:

# 100: 1
# 50: 1
# 20: 1
# 10: 1
# 5: 1
# 1: 2

# 💡 You'll need an arithmetic operator you haven't specifically practiced much yet.

# Exercise 9 — Employee Paycheck 🔴

# Ask for:

# employee name
# hourly wage
# hours worked
# tax percentage

# Calculate:

# gross pay = wage × hours
# tax amount = gross pay × tax percentage
# net pay = gross pay - tax amount

# Then print a professional-looking paycheck.

# Example:

# ========== PAYCHECK ==========

# Employee: Alex
# Hourly Wage: 25
# Hours Worked: 40
# Gross Pay: 1000
# Tax: 100
# Net Pay: 900

# ==============================

# The user should enter the tax as a percentage, e.g. 10, not 0.10.
